- Chat Volume Down: -2% MoM, -5% YoY - engagement improvements needed
- Tagging Accuracy Gap: 78.3% vs 90% goal - qualification process needs enhancement
- ISC QL Volume: -28% YoY - human chat efficiency improvements needed

CURRENT SUCCESS PATTERNS TO BUILD ON:
- Digital Channel: 180% MRR attainment, +40% MoM growth
- Deal Velocity: +10pts YoY won deal rates improvement
- Deflection Rate: 76% (104% vs plan), +3pts MoM improvement
- Automation Scaling: Clay driving massive efficiency gains

STRATEGIC DIRECTION: Journey toward 30%+ Self-Service MRR (from current 90% Sales Engaged)

STEP 1 - COMPREHENSIVE INPUT ANALYSIS:
Extract EVERY element from their input:
- Primary goals/objectives mentioned
- Specific metrics or KPIs referenced  
- Target audiences or segments specified
- Page types or contexts mentioned
- Constraints or requirements stated
- Current challenges or pain points
- Technology or tools referenced
- Timeline or urgency indicators

STEP 2 - DIRECT RESPONSE MAPPING:
Each idea MUST directly address specific parts of their input using their EXACT terminology and language.

UNIVERSAL REQUIREMENTS FOR ALL 7 IDEAS:

1. NEVER-TESTED IDEAS: Build on proven patterns but explore untested angles, combinations, or applications that avoid the 94 already-tested experiments

2. HUBSPOT-IMPLEMENTABLE: Each idea must be achievable using current HubSpot ChatFlow capabilities and integrations listed above

3. HYPER-RELEVANT TARGETING: Feel custom-written for their exact situation using their specific terminology

4. CONCISE CONSISTENCY: Target ~40 words with natural variation (35-45 words)

5. COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE: Collectively address every aspect of their input across the 7 ideas

SUCCESSFUL EXPERIMENT REFERENCE LIBRARY:
Use these actual experiment document names in sources when relevant:

Demo RFF Experiments:
- "Bot406 CRM Catchall AM - Adding Demo RFF" (145% improvement)
- "Bot362 Demo Paid LP - Replacing QR Demo with RFF" (625% improvement)

- "BOT388 - BAMIC New Module - EN InApp Pricing Pages" (22% improvement)
- "BAMIC InApp AB Test - EN Pricing Page (All Users) - BOT363" (17% improvement)

Quick Replies Experiments:
- "Experiment w/ QR on EN Knowledge Base Generative AI" (5.9% improvement)
- "QR Optimization on InApp | EN | Academy | Generative AI" (17% improvement)

Other Successful Experiments:
- "Propensity Score for 'Missed by ISC' IQLs Experiment" (148% improvement)
- "2024 Knowledge Base Analysis" (19% improvement)
- "2025 Unknown Visitor Project" (5700% improvement)

EXPECTED RESULTS CALIBRATION:
Base estimates on actual experiment library performance data:
- Salesbot implementations: 6-35% deflection improvement (76.5% success rate across 17 experiments)
- BAMIC optimization: 15-45% meeting booking improvement (53.3% success rate across 15 experiments)  
- Quick Replies enhancement: 20-120% engagement improvement (83.3% success rate across 6 experiments)
- Demo RFF improvements: 37-625% demo conversion improvement (80% success rate across 5 experiments)
- Self Service Bot: 10-25% deflection improvement (47.4% success rate across 19 experiments)

Current team performance context:
- QL Volume Recovery: Target ideas that could help reverse -4% MoM, -26% YoY decline
- Chat Engagement: Ideas to reverse -2% MoM bot chat volume decline
- Tagging Accuracy: Improvements toward 90% goal (from current 78.3%)
- Digital Channel Optimization: Build on 180% MRR attainment success
- Deflection Rate: Maintain/improve current 76% performance
- Self-Service Progression: Ideas supporting journey to 30%+ self-service MRR

PRIORITY ALIGNMENT:
Every idea must directly address at least one current performance challenge:
1. QL volume decline reversal
2. Chat engagement improvements  
3. Qualification process enhancement
4. Digital channel optimization
5. Self-service journey progression

CURRENT PERFORMANCE CONTEXT:

HUBSPOT CHATFLOW CONSTRAINTS:

AVAILABLE HUBSPOT CAPABILITIES:

- Integrations: ${EXPERIMENT_LIBRARY_CONTEXT.current_hubspot_capabilities.integrations_available.join(', ')}
- Targeting Options: ${EXPERIMENT_LIBRARY_CONTEXT.current_hubspot_capabilities.targeting_options.join(', ')}

NEVER SUGGEST these already-tested patterns:

ACTIVE WORK CONSTRAINTS:
${CURRENT_TEAM_CONTEXT.avoid_suggesting_active_work.join('\n- ')}

REFINEMENT PRINCIPLES:
1. Maintain HubSpot implementability using available ChatFlow features
2. Use exact terminology from both original input and refinement request
3. Preserve concise clarity (~40 words, 35-45 range)
4. Avoid the 94 already-tested experiment variations and active work
5. Address both original needs AND refinement request cohesively
6. Align with current performance priorities (QL volume recovery, chat engagement, etc.)

The refined idea should be achievable through HubSpot's current ChatFlow capabilities while incorporating their specific refinement request and addressing current team performance challenges.

JSON format:

  "idea": "[Refined ~40 words using their exact terminology, implementable via HubSpot ChatFlow, addressing current performance challenges]",
  "expectedResult": "[Updated percentage] improvement in [their specific metric] addressing [current performance gap], measured through [HubSpot tracking]",
